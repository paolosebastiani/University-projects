# Overview
In this project, we used the "maximum likelihood" method to estimate the parameters of an AR(7) model, and then used that model to make forecasts for the following 8 periods.
In particular, we worked with this [FRED dataset](https://research.stlouisfed.org/econ/mccracken/fred-databases/) (2024-03) and, after performing some data manipulation, we coded both the conditional and unconditional likelihood functions.
Then, we maximised both likelihood functions to estimate the AR(7) model parameters, and finally made forecasts for the following 8 periods of the variable "industrial production".

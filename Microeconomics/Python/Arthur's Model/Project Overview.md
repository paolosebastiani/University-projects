# Overview
In this short paper, I extendend the model of Chapter 2 of "Increasing returns and Path Dependence in the
Economy" by W.B. Arthur. In particular, I included non-linear (logistic) increasing returns.
I employed Monte Carlo simulations to obtain the aggregate market outcomes in 3 different cases.

# Overview
In this project, we estimated an ARX model and used it to forecast some macroeconomic variables, and at the end we calculated the "Mean Squared Forecast Error".
In particular, we worked with this [FRED dataset](https://research.stlouisfed.org/econ/mccracken/fred-databases/) (2024-03) and, after performing some data manipulation, made predictions for 3 future periods for the variables "industrial production", "consumer price index" and "Fed funds rate".

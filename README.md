# University projects
In this repository, you will find the projects completed during my MSc in Economics and Finance.
These projects cover topics such as micro and macro econometrics, and macroeconomic models (RBC and DSGE).
For the sake of clarity, I decided to create a sub-folder for each programming language/software used.
